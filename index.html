      <h2 class="center">Can therapeutic play decrease pain rating scores in pediatric patients experiencing cancer/chemo related pain when compared to pharmacological analgesics?</h2>
      <div class="float-container">
        <div class="float-child-left">
            Studies have found that childhood cancer has a very high financial burden and leads “some patients and their families to 
            make treatment decisions based on the associated cost” (Chae, 2020). A major component in the treatment of cancer is pain management. 
            As such, a group of researchers in Spain set it upon themselves to determine what impact the use of electronic video games (EVGs) 
            could have on pain relief in children with cancer. The researchers looked at 20 kids aged 4-17 who were hospitalized and were 
            receiving treatment for acute pain related to mucositis, an inflammatory condition of the mouth and/or stomach which is 
            common amongst cancer patients. The study took a quasi-experimental pre/posttest approach, meaning that they looked at metrics 
            for the same kids prior to and after having played with games. This means that the study was evidence level II (out of V) and 
            was of good quality (level B), but not high quality (for more information on evidence levels and quality follow this 
           <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/evidence-based-practice/_docs/appendix_c_evidence_level_quality_guide.pdf">website</a>).

            <b><i>A major barrier for pediatric cancer treatment is cost, which 
            "may be driven by unexpected procedures during cancer treatment, 
            including treatment of infections or <u>pain</u>" (Warner, 2014).</i></b>
        </div>

      <h3>What were the results of the study and what do they mean for practice?</h3>
      <p class="mainInfo">
        EVGs were played for a mean of 2.3 hours per day and lead to statistically significant changes. After playing, 
        there was lower daily morphine use, lower demand for pain relief, and lower pain scores across the board (Puig, 2020). 
        In summary, the researchers found that the use of EVGs has significant pain relief effect. The study was small, 
        but it has inspired more researchers to investigate the effect of both electronic and non-electronic play therapy 
        on pediatric cancer pain. If future evidence surges that suggests that this is an effective way of treating pain it 
        could easily be implemented by the healthcare team and would reduce the cost-burden associated with pediatric cancer!

          Mauricio was born and raised in Mexico City. He is a current graduate student at Johns Hopkins University 
          pursuing his MSN. Having grown up in a developing country with a huge wealth gap, and therefore incredibly unequal 
          access to healthcare, he has always been passionate about finding ways to deliver healthcare to the most 
          vulnerable populations. As such, he is looking to work with international humanitarian medical organizations 
          such as Médecins sans frontières (Doctors without borders). Additionally he is interested in medical research 
          and breakthroughs which look into treating or curing conditions for populations which have long been ignored 
          by the medical community.
